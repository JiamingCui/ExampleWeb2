Thank you for your interest!

To students already in CC@GaTech: 
If our research interests match and you have a strong data science/ML background, please drop me an email with your CV, and we can chat more. Please also mention (and this is important) which recent paper(s) of our lab interests you and why. 

To applicants for GRADUATE ADMISSION:
I am usually looking for 1-2 highly self-motivated and driven Ph.D. students who are passionate in doing data science research, and have a suitable academic background. I sometimes also work with Masters and undergraduate students as well, but usually these will be folks who have been recommended to me by faculty I know, or have taken one of my classes and done extremely well.  

Please send me your CV, mention which recent paper of our lab interests you and why, and apply to the graduate programs in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. (https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd)
Make sure you also mention my name in your application. 
The College of Computing at Georgia Tech has one of the top computing programs in the world, with outstanding faculty and an energetic and distinctive student body. 
The decisions are made by the admission committee, after input from faculty. Thus, faculty like me, can not give you any guarantee. The best advice I can give you is try to get strong letters of recommendations. Letters which favorably compare you to a past/present Georgia Tech (or a top university like CMU, Cornell, MIT, Stanford, UIUC...) student are especially useful. 
Due to the volume of emails, unfortunately I can not reply to each of them. If you send me such a message, please do not be offended if I do not reply.
